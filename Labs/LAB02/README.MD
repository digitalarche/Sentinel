## Exercise 2: Setup Alerts (Analytics) and Respond to Incident in Azure Sentinel
In this section we will configure Alerts in Azure Sentinel to generate Incidents for our security team.  During the review of these Incident we will build a Playbook to simplify the handling of these alerts.<br>

## Task 1: Log on to the My Apps portal as a **Standard User**<br>

For example, if I was assigned number 47, my username would be **user47@sentinellab.xyz**<br>

In this task you will logon to the My Apps portal as a standard user to confirm the accounts functionality.  Afterwards, you will send bad passwords to the account to simulate an unauthorized user attempting to gain access.
1.	In a browser, navigate to https://myapps.microsoft.com

2.	Enter the account information (**please notice that we are using the standard user on this step**):<br>
Username: **standardXX@sentinellab.xyz** (where “XX” is the number you have been assigned at the start of class)<br>
Password: **Provided by instructor**
4.	Confirm you have access to the My Apps portal.
5.	Close all instances of your browser and Navigate back to https://myapps.microsoft.com
6.	This time, when logging on as **standardxx@sentinellab.xyz** type in an **incorrect password**
7.	Repeat this invalid logon attempt **5 times**

## Task 2: Log on to Azure and Navigate to Sentinel<br>
In this task you will log into the Azure portal and navigate to Sentinel.


1.	In a browser, navigate to https://portal.azure.com.

2.	Enter the account information (**please notice that we are using the admin user on this step**):<br>
Username: **AdminXX@sentinellab.xyz** (where “XX” is the number you have been assigned at the start of class):<br>
Password: **Ask the trainer**
3.	This brings you to the Azure Home. In the box at the top, search for **Sentinel**.
4.	In the results, click on **Azure Sentinel**

## Task 3: Create Analytics Rule for Failed Logon
1. Click **Create** and choose **Scheduled query rule** from the flyout menu<br>

**Bonus Tip** - Notice for the other rule types that Azure sentinel support)<br>
